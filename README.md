# max--

A compiler for my own language I invented. I haven't made a formal spec website or sheet yet, but I probably will at some point. It'll be kind of like C but a bit nicer (no pointers :) )

The point was to help me learn both how the bootstrapping process works, how to self-host (just for fun), and the fun of inventing my own language.

Right now I'm focusing on max-1, a simple, minimal language spec I can use to help self-host the rest of the compiler. I'll write it in C (I was going to do assembly for pureism but that sounded a bit too painful).

The language will only compile to x86. I could have used LLVM as my target but I wanted to also learn about the backend compilation process.

## Basic setup

- Run `./compile.sh`. It'll take care of everything for you :)

If you'd rather configure some stuff:
